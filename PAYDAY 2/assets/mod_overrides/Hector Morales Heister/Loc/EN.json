Hector Morales was Colombian by birth, but spent many years on the East Coast developing power and reach of his cartel, the Sinaloans.

After a long campaign, the Federal Bureu of Intervention were able to amass enough evidence against Hector to bring him in. However, Hector and his cartel weren't the real target. The FBI Director knew that Hector was somehow connected to Crime.Net and planned to reach Bain through the Columbian. The evidence against Hector convinced him to turn state's evidence and use his connections to try to bring down Bain and the Payday gang."
